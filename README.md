# glauconic_acid
This is repository for the Glauconic Acid total synthesis project.
The corresponding publication is: "ADD HERE THE DOI".

The repository containts the final stationary points that were used to calculate the Gibbs free energies for the reaction profiles in the form of XYZ files.
It also contains the input geometries and the ORCA input files, as well as the code used for conformer clustering and the sample inputs for the CREST program.

The repository has the following structure:
-scripts
-stationary_points
  -stationary_point_0
